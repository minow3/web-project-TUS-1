            The native Taino -- who inhabited the island of Hispaniola when
            <a class="hyperlinks"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher COLUMBUS</a>
             first landed in 1492 -- were virtually wiped
            out by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the early 17th
            century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697,
            Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island, which
            later became <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haiti</a>. 
            The French colony, based on forestry and
            sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the
            Caribbean but relied heavily on the forced labor of enslaved
            Africans and environmentally degrading practices. In the late 18th
            century, <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toussaint Louverture</a>
             led a revolution of Haiti's nearly
            half a million slaves that ended France's rule on the island.
            After a prolonged struggle, and under the leadership of
             <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Dessalines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean-Jacques Dessalines</a>,
              Haiti became the first country in the
            world led by former slaves after declaring its independence in
            1804, but it was forced to pay an indemnity of 100 million francs
            (equivalent to $22 billion USD in March 2023) to France for more
            than a century and was shunned by other countries for nearly 40
            years. In 1862, the US officially recognized Haiti, but foreign
            economic influence and internal political instability induced the
            US to occupy Haiti from 1915 to 1934.

            Francois "Papa Doc" DUVALIER and then his son Jean-Claude "Baby
            Doc" DUVALIER led repressive and corrupt regimes that ruled Haiti
            in 1957-1971 and 1971-1986, respectively. Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE
            was Haiti's first democratically elected president in 1991 and was
            elected a second time in 2000, but coups interrupted his first
            term after only a few months and ended his second term in 2004.
            President Jovenel MOÏSE was assassinated in 2021, leading the
            country further into an extra-constitutional governance structure
            and contributing to the country’s growing fragility. The
            Government of Haiti then installed Ariel HENRY -- whom President
            MOÏSE had nominated shortly before his death -- as prime minister.
